First Evidence: August 24, 1920. Work is well underway on my creation. I call it The Horseman. It will serve well for the coming fight. I’m not proud but seeing as I was using the Crypt saw it most logical and efficient to use corpses found down here to help create the creature. Mainly soldiers who fell during the Great War. However, this hasn’t stopped several townsfolk from discovering it down here. Luckily, I’ve been able to have them sent to the asylum for mental evaluation. A likely story given some of their experience in the war. It’s a bad situation but it must be done. I can’t stop the experiments now. It would probably be for the best if I began to create security measures to prevent further witnesses. Perhaps I could use some more bodies.

Second Evidence: May 17, 1921. After using more specimens from the Crypt I’ve constructed living statues that serve as my eyes and ears in the village so I can keep watch over the inhabitants. I call them the Guardians. I also constructed a main statue I call Christ the Redeemer located in the Village that serves as the main spectator on all activities. It may be overkill but the less the people of this village know about my experiments the better. This will hopefully help prevent townsfolk from discovering my experiments. I don’t want to send anyone else to the Asylum if I can help it. The war is not over...

Third Evidence: December 8th, 1920. It’s been roughly 4 months since Jim was committed to the psychiatric hospital. Serving in The Great War as an infantry officer, he fought mostly in and around the nearby village primarily in the vicinity of the woods and forest. Near the end of the war, he and the rest of the officers were attacked by Cavalrymen with sabers. Jim was one of the few survivors of the whole ordeal. About ⅘ of his troop were left dead from the attack. Following this the area was bombed killing half of those survivors. Soldiers' skulls blown in the air scattering around the area. A total wasteland. The only thing still standing after the bombing was a nearby statue, later moved to the village as a way to honor those that had fallen. A crypt was built outside the city to bury the dead.Jim along with other officers have slowly been committed to the psychiatric hospital for evaluation. It’s clear that the patient suffers from shell shock. Electric shock therapy is currently the only form of treatment, if unsuccessful other operations will be considered.
